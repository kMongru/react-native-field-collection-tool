# react-native-field-collection-tool

Research Survey Tool for Western University Researchers

//Bugs

- going from summary to barcode doesn't reset barcode, going to home does? (not removed from the stack, may need nav params)
- edit modal text doesn't refresh with new text, retains the previous input text as the inital text (edit modal header working and saves information correctly)

//Next Steps

- clean up code (add components to simplify code, navigation defaults\*)
- add lab side features
- implement auth into backend, need to save more values about user profiles (orginization, name)
- implement ReportIssueScreen, BarcodeScanningScreen, SummaryScreen into backend
- audio to text feature, make it editable in the summary page

//Final Deployment

- adjust AndriodManifest.xml for softKeyboardView
- add splash screen
- add app icon
- publish application to ios and andriod app stores
